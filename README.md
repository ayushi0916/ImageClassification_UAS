# ImageClassification_UAS

The project seamlessly integrated drone-captured imagery and advanced machine learning techniques, resulting in profound insights and predictive capabilities. Through meticulous data augmentation, the hand built dataset expanded while InceptionV3 effectively extracted intricate features from the images. These features were then harnessed by the XGBoost algorithm to predict outcomes across 8,000 images. The integration of QGIS bridged the virtual predictions with the tangible world, offering a representation of the project's remarkable technological convergence and its capacity to unravel hidden complexities within data.

This project consists of all the required functions in a .py file required to run the notebook.
